# Personal Website

It's been a while since I've put my personal website up because I got frustrated about my lack of aestheticism. I'll start working on that again. Those files will live here.

I've decided I'm going to host multiple versions of my "website" since everyone I've talked to has had opinions on how and where I should set it up. It seems like a hassle to update multiple versions of it just to prove that I know different technologies, so I've decided to automate the process. I will run multiple instances of my website, each one will have its files in a different folder of this repository. On each service I host the website on, I will also run a shell script periodically via cron that checks this github repo to see if its respective folder has received a commit since the last time it checked. If so, it will pull the files down from GitHub and place them on the service in question. That way, I only need to push website changes to this GitHub repo and deployment of the sites will handle themselves.
